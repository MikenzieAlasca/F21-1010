## Files - what are they

Two types: text and binary

Binary tend to be in some proprietary format.

Text tend to have a "format" that you can use and write programs with.

Lot's of text formats:

1. Our Python Programs
2. Other Programs
3. "markdown"
4. "html"
5. "css"
6. "js"

Where are they:

How are they organized.

1. A hierarchy - Directory Tree
2. By Name
