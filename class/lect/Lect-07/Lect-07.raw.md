## Using GIT and Github.com

We are basically following most of the steps in [https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners).

## 1st Test Question

```
m4_include(feet_to_inches.py.nu)
```

1. (10pts) The above code has something wrong with it.   When the test is run it says "FAILED".
Correct the code.


## Where we are so far...

1. Installs - usually hard and unpleasant.
2. Using some files - where - paths - directories/folders.
3. Fixing some code - changes break thins - then you have to fix it.
4. Testing.   Thomas Piketty, "Capital in the Twenty-First Century".
[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS268051827620140527](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS268051827620140527)
"The Financial Times has launched a critique of the data behind the
French economist’s bestseller “Capital in the Twenty-First Century.”
...    he has also fallen prey to sloppy spreadsheets."
5. Functions
```
def fucntion_name ( parameter1, parameter2 ):
   do_someting...
   return ( output )
```
6. Input a number


## "if" / True / False

```
    if n_err == 0 :
        print ( "PASS" )
    else:
        print ( "FAILED" )
```

```
	if expression-evaluates-to-true:
		Do the true side
	elif expression-2-evaluates-to-true:
		More stuff if expression-2 is true
	else:
		if non of the above are true, do this.
```

Operators that commonly go into expressions in if:

```
==		compare for equality
!=		not equal
<		less than
>		greater than
<=		less than or equal
>=		greater than or equal
```



An Example:

The ski area sells tickets and gives a discount based on age.
Adult tickets age 18-69 are $59, Youth 5-12 are $40, Teen are $52, Children 4 and under are free, seniors 70 and older are free.

```
m4_include(ticket_price.py.nu)
```
